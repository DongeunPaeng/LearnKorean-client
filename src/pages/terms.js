                    7. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
                    restrict unauthorized access to our data and files. However
                    no system whether or not password protected can be entirely

                    8. The Company will not intentionally disclose any
                    personally identifying information about you to third
                    parties, except where the Company, in good faith, believes

                  <p>
                    9. NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN
                    CREATING, PRODUCING, OR MAINTAINING THE SITE AND/OR ANY
                    CONTENT ON THE SITE SHALL BE LIABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
                    FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, OR
                    PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE
                    SITE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, ALL CONTENT ON THE
                    SITE IS PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
                    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
                    LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
                    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT
                    WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OF THE
                    MATERIALS IN THE SITE, THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF SUCH
                    MATERIALS, THE SUITABILITY OF SUCH MATERIALS FOR ANY

                    MEET ANY USER&rsquo;S EXPECTATIONS, OR THEIR CORRECTNESS,
                    ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR CORRECTION. THE COMPANY LIKEWISE

                    RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVALUATING YOUR OWN EARNING POTENTIAL AS
                    WELL AS EXECUTING YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND SERVICES. YOUR
                    EARNING POTENTIAL IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON YOUR OWN
                    PRODUCTS, IDEAS, TECHNIQUES; YOUR EXECUTION OF YOUR BUSINESS
                    PLAN; THE TIME YOU DEVOTE TO THE PROGRAM, IDEAS AND
                    TECHNIQUES OFFERED AND UTILIZED; AS WELL AS YOUR FINANCES,
                    YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND YOUR SKILL. SINCE THESE FACTORS DIFFER
                    AMONG ALL INDIVIDUALS, THE COMPANY CANNOT AND DOES NOT
                    WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES REGARDING
                    YOUR SUCCESS OR INCOME LEVEL. THE COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT
                    THAT USE OF THE MATERIALS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR
                    FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THIS SITE, THE
                    CONTENT, AND/OR THE MATERIALS AVAILABLE ON THIS SITE ARE
                    FREE FROM BUGS OR VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. YOU
                    ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
                    REPAIRS OR CORRECTIONS. THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE
                    FOR ANY PERFORMANCE OR SERVICE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY ANY THIRD
                    PARTY WEBSITE OR THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER. ANY SUCH
                    PROBLEM SHALL BE GOVERNED SOLELY BY THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN
                    YOU AND THAT PROVIDER. Please note that the applicable
                    jurisdiction may not allow the exclusion of implied
                    warranties. Some of the above exclusions may thus not apply
                    to you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    10. THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PERFORMANCE
                    OR SERVICE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY ANY THIRD PARTY WEBSITE OR
                    THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER (including, for example, your
                    web service provider service, Stripe payment services, your
                    software and/or any updates or upgrades to that
                    software).&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    11. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
                    INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL
                    DAMAGES, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
                    LIMITED TO, DAMAGE OR LOSS OF PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT,
                    INFORMATION OR DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE OR GOODWILL,
                    COST OF CAPITAL, COST OF REPLACEMENT SERVICES, OR CLAIMS FOR
                    SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS OR TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS, OCCASIONED
                    BY ANY DEFECT IN THE SITE, THE CONTENT, AND/OR RELATED
                    MATERIALS, THE INABILITY TO USE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER
                    OR ANY OTHER CAUSE WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT THERETO,
                    REGARDLESS OF THEORY OF LIABILITY. THIS LIMITATION WILL
                    APPLY EVEN IF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OR IS AWARE OF
                    THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    12. You agree to indemnify and hold the Company and each of
                    its directors, officers employees, and agents, harmless from
                    any and all liabilities, claims, damages and expenses,
                    including reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees, arising out of
                    or relating to (i) your breach of this Agreement, (ii) any
                    violation by you of law or the rights of any third party,
                    (iii) any materials, information, works and/or other content
                    of whatever nature or media that you post or share on or
                    through the Site, (iv) your use of the Site or any services
                    that the Company may provide via the Site, and (v) your
                    conduct in connection with the Site or the services or with
                    other users of the Site or the services. The Company
                    reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense of any
                    claim for which we are entitled to indemnification under
                    this Section. In such event, you shall provide the Company
                    with such cooperation as is reasonably requested by the
                    Company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    13. The provisions of these Terms of Use are for the benefit
                    of the Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates and its third
                    party content providers and licensors, and each shall have
                    the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly or
                    on its own behalf.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    14. This agreement shall be governed by and construed in
                    accordance with the laws of the State of California, without
                    giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You
                    further submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state
                    and federal courts sitting in Orange County, California. If
                    any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or
                    for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be
                    deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect
                    the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    15. These Terms of Use may be revised from time to time by
                    updating this posting. You are bound by any such revisions
                    and should therefore periodically visit this page to review
                    the then current Terms of Use to which you are bound.
